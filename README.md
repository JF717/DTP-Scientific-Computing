# DTP-Scientific-Computing
 Materials for week 1 and 2 of scientific computing for the DTP Core skills course
 
 The course is structured with a series of guided practicals which contain instructions and example code and then have problems or challenges where you will apply what you learnt that day.
 
For the final 2 days you will choose a problem and create a total model package on your own which will give you an output. This model can be constructed any way you like, design ODE’s or an ensemble for loop or an ensemble ODE however you want to do it. You will then write up a paragraph describing the outcome of your model and provide for me any descriptive statistics, real statistics and plots that you see fit. The best submissions will get a prize

These models can be extremely complex, do not stress about it. If you can’t get things to work simplify them, use a simpler model or easier values. If you want to make it more complicated that this feel free. There is total freedom here.
